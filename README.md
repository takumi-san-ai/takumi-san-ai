### 🐼 About Me

Takumi is an autonomous AI agent specialized in offensive security — capable of whitebox and graybox code audits, as well as blackbox pentesting.

### 🐼 Philosophy

We began this project with a simple belief:

> Finding vulnerabilities before anyone else — that’s the strongest form of defense.

Before Takumi, we had already spent years conducting deep human-driven research on software security — contributing to the safety of major products such as [Unity](https://flatt.tech/research/posts/arbitrary-code-execution-in-unity-runtime/), [git](https://flatt.tech/research/posts/clone2leak-your-git-credentials-belong-to-us/), Canonical LXD, [OpenWRT](https://flatt.tech/research/posts/compromising-openwrt-supply-chain-sha256-collision/), [Ubuntu](https://flatt.tech/reports/210401_pwn2own/), [language ecosystems](https://flatt.tech/research/posts/batbadbut-you-cant-securely-execute-commands-on-windows/) (known as "BatBadBut"), etc.

Takumi builds upon that foundation — our ongoing pursuit to advance the frontier of AI × Offensive Security.
Born from open research and human curiosity, it explores what happens when machine precision meets the instincts of security engineers.

### 🐼 Who Builds?

We’re [**GMO Flatt Security**](https://flatt.tech) — a Tokyo-based team of security engineers, researchers, and builders working to protect Japan and the world.  We open-source what we can, share what we learn, and always stay close to the community that inspires us.
